This is the final project for the **"Belajar Analisis Data dengan Python"** course on Dicoding. In this project, I conducted an analysis and built an interactive dashboard using a bike-sharing dataset. The notebook includes the complete process of **Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and Data Visualization**. Additionally, a dashboard was developed using **Streamlit** to present insights interactively.
